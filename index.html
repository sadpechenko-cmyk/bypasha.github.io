                <p>This work was created as the starting point for the project and was intentionally kept simple and direct. It depicts a bold chihuahua staring straight at the viewer. I was interested in the contrast between the animal’s small size and its confident, almost confrontational expression. The direct eye contact breaks the passive role of the viewer and creates an immediate sense of presence, as if the chihuahua is demanding attention rather than simply being observed. I chose to begin the project with this piece to start in an accessible way and ease into the process. Humour became a tool to set the tone of the project and make the work feel approachable before moving toward more complex ideas and techniques.</p>

                <p>This GIF originates from a photograph depicting two a quiet and seemingly ordinary moment. Rather than preserving the image as a static document, I approached it as material to be transformed. My intention was to explore how images shift through processes of repetition. The photograph was first converted into a bitmap and printed, after flattening it into a more mechanical, fragile form. From there, each frame of the animation was created by physically scanning the printed image, allowing everything to emerge naturally through the process. This method introduces a tension between analogue and digital processes, slowing down image production while resulting in a digital loop. The flickering, unstable quality of the GIF reflects the way memory functions as it is never fully fixed, slightly altered each time it is revisited. By translating a still photograph into a looping animation through physical intervention, the work reflects on time, and the instability of documentation. The GIF becomes less about the specific people or place and more about the act of remembering, copying, and re-seeing an image that can never fully return to its original state.</p>

                <p>This GIF was created through a material process that reinterprets an image of a man climbing stairs by focusing on the staircase rather than the figure itself. The stair shape was cut out of paper and treated as a movable object, allowing it to exist independently from its original context. Each frame was produced by physically placing the paper stairs onto different surfaces. A key focus of the process was achieving clean and controlled colour transitions between frames. Surfaces were carefully selected so that shifts in tone feel smooth and continuous, helping the movement appear  deliberate. By removing the human figure and isolating the stairs, the GIF shifts from a specific moment to a more universal reflection on repetition, effort, and gradual upward movement.</p>

                <p>This GIF was created as a stop-motion animation using everyday objects found in my room. I have decided ti transform them into elements of a beach scene. The sand is made from crushed cookies, chosen for their texture and colour, which visually resemble a shoreline while clearly remaining an artificial material. Paper cut-outs, fabric, and small objects were arranged and moved frame by frame to form waves, sea life, and details along the coast. Each movement is the result of a small physical adjustment, allowing the animation to emerge through repetition rather than digital effects. By constructing a beach from domestic materials, the GIF becomes an imagined landscape shaped by memory, play, and simple transformation.</p>

                <p>This GIF functions as a self-portrait that brings together two of my most frequently used media: photography and drawing. I drew elements of clown makeup directly onto the photograph, allowing drawn marks to interrupt and reshape the realism of the image. This combination creates a tension between the documentary nature of photography and the expressive  quality of drawing. The GIF format reinforces this idea by adding repetition and slight movement, preventing the portrait from feeling resolved. By including this self-portrait in the project, I wanted to anchor the work in something personal while also exploring how identity can be layered, altered, and performed through different visual media.</p>

                <p>I added additional GIFs to this project as a way of challenging myself and expanding my practice into unfamiliar territory. Since GIFs are not a medium I usually work with, I saw this project as an opportunity to experiment, test different processes, and explore new ways of thinking about movement, repetition, and time.</p>
